# Deep-Learning-Challenge
Data Bootcamp Week 21 HW on deep learning
This homework challenge was to use machine learning to predict which applicants would have the best chance at success with funding from a nonprofit called Alphabet Soup.  

I found this challenge to be difficult.  I tried to get my HDF5 files to save and the code is technically correct but the files did not populate.  I used Xpert Learning Chatbot and the Titanic exercise from in class with Prof. Booth.
